# MagicPrompt's Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is designed to help you enhance the quality of your prompts. It utilizes a MagicPrompt function that acts as both a prompt reviewer and generator. To use this tool, you'll need to provide your OpenAI API key (as it leverages GPT-4o), your prompt, and a threshold value—a number between 0 and 1—that indicates the desired excellence of the generated response.

A threshold value above 0.95 typically yields an excellent response. However, please note that setting a lower threshold will result in a simpler prompt, which may execute slightly faster.
